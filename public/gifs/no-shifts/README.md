# No Shifts GIFs

This folder contains animated GIFs that randomly appear on the "No Shifts" page.

## How It Works

- Currently using a fallback GIF from Giphy
- Once you add GIFs to this folder, share them with me and I'll update the code to use them
- The app will randomly select one GIF each time the no shifts page loads

## Adding New GIFs

1. Find a fun GIF you like
2. Share it in the chat
3. I'll add it to this folder and update the code to include it in the rotation

## Current GIFs

No local GIFs added yet. Using fallback GIF: https://media.giphy.com/media/artj92V8o75VPL7AeQ/giphy.gif

- Supported format: .gif
- Recommended: Optimized for web (under 2MB for fast loading)
- Images display at 342px width × 240px height with rounded corners
